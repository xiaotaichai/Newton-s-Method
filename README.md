These problems are from the Numerical Optimization text by Nocedal and Wright, Second Edition.

Start early. This requires some coding.


Part A) 

Exercises: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4. 

It is to be submitted here via a PDF file.

Part B)

For 2.1, 2.2, and 2.4 above, use Python to plot the functions and plot points for where you are evaluating these functions.

Part C)

Exercise: 3.1, but only the Newton's method part and no line search is required. However, have your code plot in 2D the places where the evaluations occurred so it will be easy to see the path the search algorithm took.
